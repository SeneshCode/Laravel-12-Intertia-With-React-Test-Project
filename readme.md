## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Laravel** as the backend framework, **Inertia.js** as the bridge between the backend and frontend, and **React** as the frontend library. The goal is to provide a seamless full-stack development experience where you can build interactive user interfaces without the complexity of traditional APIs.

Key Features:
- Laravel 12 as the backend.
- Inertia.js for server-side rendering and page navigation.
- React for building dynamic frontend components.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can start exploring and modifying it to suit your learning needs. Here are some things you can do:

- **Create New Pages**: Add new routes in `routes/web.php` and corresponding React components in `resources/js/Pages`.
- **Interact with the Database**: Use Laravel's Eloquent ORM to create models, seed data, and perform CRUD operations.
- **Customize Styles**: Modify the CSS/SCSS files in `resources/css` to change the look and feel of your application.
